## 1. Best Practices

- [Best practices for monitoring cloud applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/monitoring)
- [The Three Pillars of Observability](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/ch04.html)

## 2. General Tools

Before to start with huge observability solution. If you just need to control some application aspects, visualize how is working your system, or just identify a problem, may be usefull start with one, or a collection application, that help you to get this information in a __easy__ and __cheap__ way.

Additional to this, start with tools to get information about your system to determine if it's working well, can help you to define the final stack if you want to install a corporative solution to any project. I know some stories abot people that install, configure and even evolution some monitoring tools as a corporative solution, an when the solution is in production, they realize that the tools don't cover all the necessaries to control their applications :-D

Following you can see an interesting post from Netflix writteb by [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/) that show this very clear.

https://netflixtechblog.com/linux-performance-analysis-in-60-000-milliseconds-accc10403c55

In the article you can see how with a few tools and in a short time, you can get a lot of information about your system ;-)

```
 $ uptime
 $ dmesg | tail
 $ vmstat 1
 $ mpstat -P ALL 1
 $ pidstat 1
 $ iostat -xz 1
 $ free -m
 $ sar -n DEV 1
 $ sar -n TCP,ETCP 1
 $ top
```

There are many more commands and methodologies you can apply to drill deeper.
